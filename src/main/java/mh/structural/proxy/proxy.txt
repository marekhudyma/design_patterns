Proxy
- Proxy is similar to Adapter and Facade but is built in different purpose

- object has the same interface as object that is invoked, but we override it,
- client uses Proxy, but he doesnâ€™t know that is not real object,
- Proxy delegate invocation to real object and return value of invocation,

Proxy Usage:
- Remote Proxy
- invocation is delivered by network to real object (for example RMI or Webservices),
- Virtual Proxy
- during loading real object, for example during loading image,
- Protection Proxy - check permissions before share object
