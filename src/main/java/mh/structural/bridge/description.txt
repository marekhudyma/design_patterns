Bridge is like Adapter – convert one interface to another – but there were different intentions !
Adapter creates an interface for existing class so it looks like different class.
Bridge separate interface from implementation. We can change implementation without changing code that use it.

- we use it on early stage of project, when we don’t know interface nor implementation,
- separate abstraction from implementation, we can develop both independently,
- abstraction define general view of object
- action is transfered to implementation
- it is similar to Adapter
Bridge usage
- during designing,
- when we don’t know what would be the functionality
- when we want to make independent API and implementation
