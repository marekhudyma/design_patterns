//Factory Method
//- we use Product, but method of creation of product can change, so we want to separate creation of product.
//- we put creation of product to separate method. We can override only this method
//- if there is a new ProcuctC, we create a new ClassC (and override one method) and create ProductC
//Efects:
//-fulfill the Open-Close,
//-donâ€™t have to change existing code,
//-add new code,
//-no code duplication
